## 

I'm a MD-PhD candidate at Stanford University. Previously, I graduated from Harvard College with a degree in developmental biology/history of science and completed a Marshall Scholarship at Imperial College London. 

I was a 2022 AAAS Mass Media Fellow and [contributing writer](https://www.wired.com/author/maggie-chen/) for WIRED Science, where I covered everything from [long COVID](https://www.wired.com/story/the-secrets-of-covid-brain-fog-are-starting-to-lift/) to [sea cucumbers](https://www.wired.com/story/what-humans-can-learn-from-the-sea-cucumbers-toxic-arsenal/). I've also written for [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/18/style/tiny-modern-love-stories-coronavirus-the-other-iris.html?smid=tw-share), [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/colon-cancer-linked-to-mouth-bacteria/), and [The Scientist](https://www.the-scientist.com/an-epigenetic-strategy-to-control-bad-cholesterol-71772). I cover biology, biotechnology, health, and funky animals.
