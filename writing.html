Recently, I wrote about the use of <a href="https://www.growbyginkgo.com/2024/08/30/making-new-biology/" target="_blank">generative AI</a> to create new biology. I've also covered <a href= "https://www.wired.com/story/the-fall-of-roe-makes-complex-pregnancies-even-riskier/" target="_blank">Roe v Wade</a>, <a href="https://ideasmatter.co/2024/03/27/what-is-healthy-aging/" target="_blank">aging and longevity biology</a>, and COVID (<a href= "https://www.wired.com/story/these-vaccines-will-take-aim-at-covid-and-its-entire-sars-lineage/" target="_blank">here, </a>, <a href= "https://www.wired.com/story/long-covid-breathlessness-monocytes-symptoms/" target="_blank">here, </a> and <a href= "https://www.wired.com/story/unruly-gut-fungi-can-make-your-covid-worse-infection-coronavirus-candida-albicans/" target="_blank">here</a>. 

In 2020, I wrote about my family in a <a href= "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/18/style/tiny-modern-love-stories-coronavirus-the-other-iris.html?smid=tw-share" target="_blank">Tiny Love Story</a> for the New York Times' Modern Love Column.
